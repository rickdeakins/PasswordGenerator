# PasswordGenerator

## Description
The sole purpose of this application is to generate a random password using a series of prompts. 
The user is initially prompted to choose a password length that is no less than eight characters and no longer than 128 characters.   
Then the user must confirm if they want their password to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

## Functionality
If the user does not choose a password length within the established parameters the application returns to the main screen. 
As long as the user selects a password length within the established parameters they will be directed to select their choice of characters.
Once all user requirements have been satisfied, the randomly generated password will be displayed on the screen.

## Observations
The script that allows the application to function as desired was a chaotic mess initially, however further research and reference to previously completed class projects
were trivial for the success of this application. Once I was able to understand conceptually the necessary steps to completion, it was a matter of reformatting my existing 
code to ensure that all operations were being completed at the correct times.
